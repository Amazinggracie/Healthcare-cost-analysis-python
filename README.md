# Healthcare-cost-analysis-python
Python project analyzing what drives healthcare costs using real-world data.
This project explores the drivers behind medical insurance charges using real-world healthcare data (2,700+ patient records). It focuses on applying core data analyst skills using Python including data cleaning, exploration, and insight extraction without machine learning.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Explore what factors influence medical charges (e.g., smoking status, region, age, BMI)
- Clean and transform real-world healthcare data
- Visualize key patterns and relationships in the data
- Translate data insights into potential healthcare and insurance decisions

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (via Anaconda)
- Data cleaning and validation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature transformation
- Healthcare domain context

## 📊 Highlights

- Found that **smokers pay ~3x more** than non-smokers
- **Region and age** also significantly influence medical charges
- Shared daily progress via LinkedIn with visuals and insights
- Final results summarized in a professional project wrap-up
